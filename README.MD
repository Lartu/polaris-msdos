**Polaris** is a stack-based, interpreted programming language with strings as its only data type.
It has been designed to be **small** in size and **minimal** in language features. **Polaris** was
conceived to run under **MS-DOS** and **Unix** systems, and it consists entirely of a single **.c** file.
The whole interpreter size is under **40 KiB** and can also be used as an **embeddable language** in
any C or C++ project.
